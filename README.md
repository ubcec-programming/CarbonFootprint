# UBCEC Programming - CarbonFootprintApp

### Problem Statement
With the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicting that we only have 12 more years to prevent global 
warming from increasing to the irreversible threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, it is important that we reduce our carbon footprint on all 
levels, whether in industry or in our personal lives. This app aims to reduce the substantially large footprint that agriculture accounts 
for by raising awareness of the carbon footprint of what we eat. 

### Intended Functioning 
When you first open the app, you should see a pie chart showing you the representative percentages of the carbon
footprint you have made through your food choices which are logged into the app by clicking on the (+) button and selecting a food option
that were imported from .csv files.

### Scalability
The app could be scaled up to allow users to add new food options to a database.
